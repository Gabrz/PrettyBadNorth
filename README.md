# Pretty Bad North
A p5.js sketch that generates an island using the Wave Function Collapse Algorithm

Built after watching streams of The Coding Train (Choo Choo). It's not perfect, but I had a lot of fun building it.

I have some more Ideas(see TODO), but very little time. (Already spent way to much time on this project)

#### TODO

- Come up with a better weight system.
  (based on Axis? instead of just some random numbers because they work)
- Fiddle around with adjacencies.
  (box next to air)
- Make new Meshes.
  (corner that is not a slope)
- Convert box to Geometry with vertices.
  (so top and side can have separate colors)
- Refactor the gui.
  (more structured)
